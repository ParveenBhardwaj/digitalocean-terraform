# TutoriaLinux Digitalocean Terraform mini-course extravaganza!
A quick terraform tutorial for setting up load balanced web servers in digitalocean.

This repository goes along with the [free YouTube terraform course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JAx2npuprk&list=PLtK75qxsQaMIHQOaDd0Zl_jOuu1m3vcWO)

It contains the terraform code that you can use to follow along and set up a haproxy-load-balanced group of webservers.

Have fun!
